# Just A Media Downloader (ACTIVE DEV)
This repo 9 times outa 10 will be a unstable, unbuilt version of JamDL, this is here to show that development on JamDL is still active.

#### Why use another branch just use master
I want the master branch to be a place to get a working build of JamDLs source code, not some frankenstein, prototype pre-build of JamDL. If you want that download from here
